### Description

If you are looking for simple, then i don't know how much more simple this CAN be to create and use a dll in your project for much easier use. This project just uses a few API calls as for what i have it to, but i will bet anyone can learn how to make and use dll's in just a few minutes. If i get a lot of positive feedback on this i will create much, much more to this CURRENT dll that i have started. Love to know if i have helped you. If so, i might start creating tutorials
